# Commit

Create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages.

## Process

1. Check for staged changes (`git status`)
2. If no staged changes, review and stage appropriate files
3. Run pre-commit checks (unless --no-verify)
4. Analyze changes to determine commit type
5. Generate descriptive commit message
6. Include scope if applicable: `type(scope): description`
7. Add body for complex changes explaining why
8. Execute commit

## Commit Types

## Format

```
<emoji> <type>(<optional scope>): <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

## Best Practices

- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write in imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Explain why, not just what
- Reference issues/PRs when relevant
- Split unrelated changes into separate commits

## Usage

- `/commit` - Standard commit with pre-commit checks
- `/commit --no-verify` - Skip pre-commit checks

## Examples

```

Implements Google and GitHub OAuth providers.
Closes #123
```

```
