# Skills

Skills are reusable, composable capabilities that extend GitHub Copilot Chat with specialized knowledge and workflows.

## What are Skills?

Skills provide:
- **Specialized knowledge** for specific domains (e.g., .NET testing, dependency management)
- **Structured workflows** for common development tasks
- **Tool permissions** to control what actions a skill can perform
- **Progressive disclosure** with references for advanced scenarios

## Skill Structure

Skills are defined in `.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```
.github/
└── skills/
    └── dotnet-test/
        ├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill definition
        └── references/
            ├── theory-parameter-filtering.md
            ├── blame-mode.md
            └── parallel-execution.md
```
