# Session Reflection Guide

Learn from your AI coding sessions by capturing what worked, what didn't, and patterns to reuse.

## Purpose

Session reflection is **meta-analysis** - focusing not on what was built, but on HOW the work was done:

- **Capture effective patterns** - What approaches worked well?
- **Document lessons learned** - What would you do differently?
- **Build personal knowledge** - Accumulate tips and tricks over time

## When to Reflect

- After complex multi-step tasks
- When discovering new effective patterns
- After significant debugging sessions
- When a session went particularly well (or badly)
- Before ending a long work session

## Using the Reflect Prompt

This repo includes a `/reflect` prompt for generating structured reflections:

```
/reflect api-migration
```

Or let it auto-derive a name:

```
/reflect
```

The prompt creates a markdown file at `.copilot/reflections/<date>-<name>.md`.

## Reflection Structure

### What Went Well

Identify effective techniques:
- Problem-solving approaches that worked
- Tool usage that was particularly helpful
- Communication patterns that produced good results
- Planning strategies that paid off

### What Went Wrong

Document issues for future avoidance:
- Approaches that didn't work or caused delays
- Tool misuse or inefficiency
- Unnecessary iteration or backtracking
- Context management problems

### Lessons Learned

Extract actionable insights:
- Each lesson should inform future behavior
- Be specific about what to do differently
- Include the "why" behind the lesson

### Tips & Tricks

Capture useful patterns discovered:
- Specific prompting techniques
- Workflow shortcuts
- Configuration discoveries
- Tool combinations that work well

## Example Reflection

```markdown
# Session Reflection: API Migration

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Session Goal**: Migrate REST API endpoints to new versioned structure

---

## What Went Well

- Breaking migration into phases (routes → handlers → tests) kept scope manageable
- Using Agent mode for bulk file moves with pattern matching
- Keeping a checklist in _plans/ prevented missing endpoints

## What Went Wrong

- Started without checking existing test coverage - had to backtrack
- Tried to migrate everything in one conversation - context got confused
- Forgot to update API documentation until the end

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check test coverage first**: Before any refactor, know what's tested. Saves debugging time.
2. **One conversation per phase**: Don't mix migration phases in same context.

## Action Items

- [ ] Add "check test coverage" to personal migration checklist
- [ ] Create prompt template for API migrations

## Tips & Tricks

- **Tip**: Use `@workspace find all routes` to get comprehensive endpoint list
- **Tip**: Agent mode + explicit file patterns = reliable bulk operations

## Building a Knowledge Base

Over time, reflections accumulate into a personal knowledge base:

```
.copilot/reflections/
  2026-02-01-auth-debugging.md
  2026-02-03-test-refactoring.md
  2026-02-05-api-migration.md
```

Periodically review reflections to:
- Identify recurring patterns (good and bad)
- Extract tips into instruction files
- Create prompts for common workflows

## Generalization Opportunities

If a reflection reveals a repeatable pattern, consider creating:

| Pattern Type | Create |
|--------------|--------|
| Repeated workflow | Custom prompt |
| Specialized task | Agent configuration |
| Multi-step process | Skill with reference files |
| Common instructions | Add to instruction files |

Only generalize patterns that genuinely recur across multiple contexts. Premature abstraction adds complexity without benefit.

## Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Trigger | End of significant session |
| Generate | Use `/reflect` prompt |
| Review | Read and refine the output |
| Store | Keep in `.copilot/reflections/` |
| Apply | Use insights in future sessions |
| Generalize | Create prompts/instructions from patterns |
